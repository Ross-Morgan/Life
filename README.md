# Life Simulator

Welcome to Life.

The developers of the universe have congregated and concluded with a definition of life:
1. `coding`
2. `coffee`
3. `sleep`

##### (in order of priority)

## Please Note:

- Voice linters are reccomended for automated communication critiquing

## Rules of Society:


#### Economy:
- Personal capital is measured by total size of GitHub repositories
- Social Credit is based off of StackOverflow reputation
- Tax scales inverse to total size of repositories
- Coffee will be completely subsidised by taxes within the next 2 weeks

#### Religion:
- The international religion is x86 Assembly
- x86 ASM users are holy prophets


#### Etiquette:
- All socialising outside of StackOverflow, GitHub and Slack is now considered rude and will soon be criminalised.
- C++ Users are to be respected in all circumstances besides decisions involving legacy features
- Python users are like mushrooms; some are toxic, some are nice
- All VBA, Obj-C and Perl users should be shot-on-sight
- Go to VHDL users for logical advice
- Coq users should to be reffered to as `James May #{serial-number}` while `James May #0` is reserved for the man himself
- Windows users are to be looked down upon

#### Laws:
- Breaching repository licences may result in capital punishment
- Inadequate coffee consumption will result in your mandatory participation in a 10 hour `Java DSA course`
- Don't undermine anyone using a more complex language than your native (excluding aforementioned legislature)
- Everything you say must be abstracted to the highest scenario-appropriate level
