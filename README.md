# Life Simulator

Welcome to Life.

The developers of the universe have congregated and concluded with a definition of life:
1. `coding`
2. `coffee`
3. `sleep`

##### (in order of priority)

## Please Note:

- Voice linters are reccomended for automated communication critiquing

---

## Rules of Society:


#### Economy:
- Personal capital is measured by total GitHub Stars
- Social Credit is based off of StackOverflow reputation
- Tax scales inverse to total size of repositories
- Coffee will be completely subsidised by taxes within the next 2 weeks

#### Religion:
- The international religion is the `Rust Compiler` in it's infinite wisdom
- `Rust` users are holy prophets


#### Etiquette:
- All socialising outside of StackOverflow, GitHub and Slack is now considered rude and will soon be criminalised.
- `C++` Users are to be respected in most circumstances besides decisions involving legacy features
- `Python` users are like mushrooms; some are toxic, some are nice
- All `VBA`, `Objective-C` and `Perl` users should be shot-on-sight
- Go to `VHDL` users for logical advice
- Windows users are to be looked down upon

#### Laws:
- Breaching repository licences may result in capital punishment
- Inadequate coffee consumption will result in your mandatory participation in a 72 hour `Java DSA course`
- Never interrupt anyone using a more complex language than your native (excluding aforementioned legislature)
- Everything you say must be abstracted to the highest scenario-appropriate level
- Anyone found guilty of using `Javascript` for logical comparison will be admitted to their nearest mental asylum

# Briefing

This is your portable host for your digital self in this digitally developed universe

Hope that the x86 gods let fate grant you `200`, and that they do not send you to the `403` `404` land of JavaScript's logic

## Running
---

To run your life, run `python3 src/life.py`

### Custom Tasks:

Define any custom tasks within class `Life` with a `weight` of type `int` to have them be added to the `EventLoop`
